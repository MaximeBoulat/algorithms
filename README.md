# algorithms
This project demonstrates the implementations of various algorithms in Swift and Objective-C.

### The app portion of this app features 3 tabs:

* Maze: demonstrates maze generation, followed by path finding using breadth first graph traversal.
* Views: demonstrates graph traversal to identify common superview and to identify a subview in the clone of a view hierarchy.
* Sierpinsky: An implementation of the Sierpinsky fractal using recursion.

### The Tests portion of the app runs and verifies the following algorithms in both Objective C and Swift:

* Shift zeroes.
* Remove duplicates.
* Location sort.
* Insertion sort.
* Merge sort.
* Quick sort.
* Palindrome.
* Binary tree to list.
* Permutations.
* Swap nodes of linked list.
* Traversing nested arrays.
